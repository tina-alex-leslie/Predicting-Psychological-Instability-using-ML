st.markdown('Millions of people globally suffer from depression and it is a debilitating condition. At best it can be difficult for people to live their lives normally and happily, and at worst it leads to death by suicide. Primary care doctors are overwhelmingly finding that they are faced with the need to treat mental health conditions such as depression without any particular training of how to handle such cases.')
st.markdown('There is evidence that an integrated approach where physicians regularly screen patients for mental health disorders and work together with psychologists and other mental health professionals to treat patients leads to reduced costs and better patient outcomes. However, this approach can require a lot of buy-in from many individuals, require extra training, and is often not logistically feasible.')
st.markdown('Using data from the [CDC National Health and Examination Survey](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx), machine learning was applied to predict patients who may have depression based on information that could typically be found in a medical file. These predictions could be used to put patients in touch with experienced mental health professionals sooner and easier.')
